### Explore the dataset  

To get started, please open the [Global Forest Change app](https://glad.earthengine.app/view/global-forest-change#dl=1;old=off;bl=off;lon=20;lat=10;zoom=3;) to explore the dataset.

_Discuss the layers shown in app and highlighted locations/cases._  

### Tutorial  

Please work through Matt Hansen's Earth Engine tutorial. You may work in groups if you prefer. While working through the tutorial, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/8BWXvZWvf6fD6inW6). It asks for your feedback on how familiar you are with the methods and concepts in the tutorial.
