Welcome to my Earth Engine primer!

These materials aim to help undergraduate students in Geography and Environmental Studies learn geospatial methods for investigating the global environment. While most of the lessons introduce methods and workflows in Google Earth Engine, I also show students around QGIS and how to move between the two platforms. The ultimate goal of the materials is to help students learn timeless concepts of geospatial analysis that transcend specific software platforms. That is the goal at least. 

I use the materials to teach undergraduates at Middlebury College (Vermont, USA) and revise the materials every fall semester while teaching. This means that I scrub the site in September and then publish revised materials each week through December.  

Please contact me if you have any questions.
