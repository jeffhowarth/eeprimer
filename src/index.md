# Introduction  

These materials aim to help undergraduate students explore and understand changes in the global environment using Google Earth Engine.    

## Revision cycle  

I am developing these materials to teach a course in Environmental Studies and Geography at Middlebury College (USA). I update this content continuously during the fall semester (Sept - Dec) when I offer the course. After this, the content tends to remain static while I work on other projects. Then when the leaves start turning yellow again, I begin making revisions.  

## Organization  

If you are new to [Google Earth Engine][gee]{target=_blank}, the first section aims to help you set up an account, introduces the web-based Code Editor, and then quickly introduces some key terms and practices in javascript, which we will use for writing scripts in the Code Editor.  

The **lesson plans** contain short projects that I use for about a week of instruction in a 12 week semester. 

The **code catalog** introduces code snippets to implement concepts with Google Earth Engine's code editor. These snippets aim to describe recurring chunks of code that recur across workflows.   

The **concept catalog** is poorly developed on this repo as I currently introduce much of this content at the blackboard in the classroom. At present, this section includes some key words, concepts, and principles of geospatial analysis.   

I use problem sets to assess near and far transfer of understanding. In my course, these function as exams and for that reason I keep them in a private repository. If you are an instructor who would like access to these materials, please contact me.
