# Inspect an image.

You can print an image to the Console, though this won't visualize the image with color. It returns 'matadata' (data about data). Dry as this sounds you can learn some things from it.

```js
// Inspect an image.

print('label', data_object);        // Where data_object is the name of the variable that holds the image.  

```

In the Console panel, expand the 'carrots' to explore the properties and bands of the image. Please note that an image will alway contain at least one band. The name of the band is in double quotes. The default name of the first band in an image is "b1" (short for band one).  

You can also inspect an image with the Inspector panel. With the crosshair, click on a location and the value of each band in each image at that location will print to the Inspector panel.
