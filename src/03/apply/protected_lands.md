# Area-based conservation goals at the town scale  

In January 2022, Amy Sheldon of Middlebury introduced [H.606](https://legislature.vermont.gov/bill/status/2022/H.606){target=_blank} to the Committee on Natural Resources, Fish, and Wildlife in Montpelier, Vermont. "An act relating to community resilience and biodiversity protection" would require the State of Vermont to protect 30 percent of lands and waters in the state by 2030 and 50 percent by 2050. The conserved land would permanently protect natural landcover with different degrees of human use and resource extraction and include a mixture of ecological reserve areas, biodiversity conservation areas, natural resource management areas, and sustainable forest management areas. For much of Vermont, natural land cover is forested land cover or early-successional forest cover, in contrast to open, bare, and impervious land cover maintained by agriculture and development.  

The bill passed the House in March and then passed the Senate two months later. On May 12, 2022, the bill was delivered to Governor Scott for his signature. On June 2, the Governor [vetoed the bill](https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2022/Docs/JOURNAL/hj220512.pdf#page=232){target=_blank} and wrote:  

: "Vermont has a long history of effective land conservation that has significantly
contributed to the state’s vibrant, resilient working landscape of farms and
forests, vast natural areas, and world class opportunities for outdoor recreation.
This is a result of flexible and innovative tools like our current use program
and the payment-for-ecosystem-services model. These programs are critical to
achieving our conservation priorities because they combine conservation
planning with incentives – making it more attractive and affordable for
Vermont families to keep and conserve their land, farms and forests.  

: "Over the course of the legislative session, the Agency of Natural Resources
testified multiple times against this bill. Among the objections, the Agency
pointed to the conservation goals established in H.606 are unnecessarily tied to
– and unreasonably limited to – permanent protection. The Agency has
repeatedly said that permanent preservation has not been, and cannot be, the
state’s exclusive conservation tool and this bill, intentional or not, would
diminish the existing and successful conservation tools we have.
Based on the objections outlined above, I am returning this legislation without
my signature pursuant to Chapter II, Section 11 of the Vermont Constitution."  

Your goal for this week is to develop a tool to assess the landcover of lands with permanent protections and lands registered in the [Current Use and Value Appraisal Program](https://agriculture.vermont.gov/land-use-renewable-energy/current-use-and-value-appraisal-program){target=_blank} within any Vermont town and create a chart to evaluate 30 by '30 and 50 by '50 goals at the town scale.    

The app below illustrates the basic tool that you will make using the case of Middlebury, Vermont.
