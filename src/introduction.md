These materials aim to help undergraduate students in Geography and Environmental Studies learn geospatial methods for investigating changes in the global environment. While most of the lessons introduce methods and workflows in Google Earth Engine, I also show students around QGIS and how to move between the two platforms. The ultimate goal of the materials is to help students learn timeless concepts of geospatial analysis that transcend specific software platforms. That is the goal at least.
