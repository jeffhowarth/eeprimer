# Earth Engine Code Editor  

We will use the web-based [Code Editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/){target=_blank} for Earth Engine. You might as well bookmark this site in your browser. It provides an interface for writing and running code, while also providing tools for managing files and assets, composing and inspecting maps, finding documentation, and printing results and widgets.  

The diagram shown below is from [Google's Earth Engine documentation](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/playground){target=_blank}.

As you can see, the Code Editor consists of a lot of panels and buttons. As you use the code editor, you will quickly become familiar with navigating the interface. In our first lab meeting, we will go over the following common tasks.
