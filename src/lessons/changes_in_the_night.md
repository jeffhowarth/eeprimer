##Introduction  

The US military designed the [Operational Line-Scan System (OLS)](https://eogdata.mines.edu/products/dmsp/){target=_blank} of the Defense Meteorological Program (DMSP) to observe weather patterns with satellites. Unexpectedly, the system also proved capable of detecting visible and near-infrared (VNIR) emission sources at night.

- What do you think are sources of bright lights at night?  
- What do you think we could learn by studying changes in these lights over time?  

##Concepts     

- [Band and Image](../concepts/bands_image.md)  
- [RGB composites](../concepts/rgb_composites.md)  
- [Additive color](../concepts/additive_color.md)  

##Activity    

With the app below, please select from the 'Explore a pattern' list. For each pattern:  

1. Click on locations in the pattern to explore it and draw charts of the pixel values for each band.
2. Use the [additive color keys](../concepts/additive_color.md){target=_blank} to describe the changes symbolized by the charts.
3. For each pattern, identify at least one analogous place (where you see the same pattern) in another part of the world and write down the placename so that we can use the search bar to return to the place.  
4. Explore the map to find another pattern not described in the pattern list.
