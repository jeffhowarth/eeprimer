## Introduction  

What is a _spectral signature_ chart and how do these charts serve as guides for making and reading RGB composites?

## Spectral signature app       

We will explore spectral signatures from Sentinel 2 images with [**this app**](https://jhowarth.users.earthengine.app/view/spectral-signatures){target=_blank}.      

## Start with familiar    

1. Pan and zoom to playing fields at Middlebury College.
2. Sample two locations in the field encircled by the track.  
3. Use [this key](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S2_SR_HARMONIZED){target=_blank} to interpret how reflectance changes with wavelength.  
4. Create NIR and SWIR  false color composites and explain what the colors mean.  

## Revisit Muynak  

1. Type "Muynak, Uzbekistan" into the app's Search bar.
2. Pan out a little and redraw the scene.
3. Clear chart and samples.
4. Create signature charts for bright green, bright cyan, black, and white pixels.
5. Move between false color and natural color composites.
6. What do you think the different colors represent?  

## Gather a library         

Please gather a library of spectral signatures for the following land cover types:  

1. Salt flats
2. Water with algae  
3. Clear water
4. Water with silt  
5. Sand  
6. Snow  
7. Coniferous forest  
8. Deciduous forest with leaves on
9. Deciduous forest with leaves off  
10. Cultivated crops   
11. Grassland  
12. Asphalt

For each, please sample two points. So your chart should have two lines total and the lines should be similar. If they aren't similar, clear the chart and try again. They don't need to be _exactly_ identical, but they should show similar signatures.

Please use this [**Google form**](https://forms.gle/fvD4W9UM2x55MQjV9){target=_blank} to submit each chart. You can take a break and return to your work if necessary, so use this form to make 12 individual submissions. Please use the lecture time today to make progress on this task and complete your submissions **by 5pm on Friday 11/11** or contact me if you would like to request additional time. Thank you.

##App instructions      

1. Pan map to a place you would like to explore.  

    - Click, hold, and drag map to pan.  
    - Click + or - to zoom in or out.  

2. Add a S2 image to the map.

    - Click DRAW S2 scene at map center.  

3. Change the date range filter for the image.  

    - This will let you change the season or year of the image that you add to the map.  
    - Check the _Define start and end dates_ box.  
    - Enter a start and end date to define a time window.   
    - You must use YYYY-MM-DD format.
    - Try to use two month windows.  
    - Click the _DRAW S2 scene at map center_ button to apply your date filter.
    - If the layer panel on the map turns red, try changing the date window and click the _DRAW_ button again.  

4. Plot spectral signature at one or more sample points for each land cover type.  

    - Check the _Explore spectral signatures_ box.  
    - Click a location on the map to chart the spectral signature of that location based on date in the S2 image.  
    - You can click more than one location to add multiple signatures to the chart.  
    - Click _Clear chart and samples_ to, well, to do that.  
    - If you get a chart error, clear the chart and try again.  

5. Download the spectral signature chart as a .png.        

    - Click the little gray icon in the upper right corner to open the chart in a new browser tab.  
    - Click the _Download PNG_ to download the chart as an image to your Google drive.
