Together, map center and zoom level define a map's extent. You can customize the map extent by changing the map center and zoom level like this:   

```js
// Set map center and zoom.  

Map.setCenter(-73.1812983597342, 44.013157468373876, 19);
```

At this zoom level, how many decimal places do you really need to center the map at this location?<br>
<br><i>Hint: remove a decimal from the two coordinates and re-run the script. Repeat until you see first see BiHall move (just a tad).</i>
