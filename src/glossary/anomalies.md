## Introduction  

Anomalies report differences between one or more parts and the whole. They are comparisons that investigate how something "differs from normal". 

## Temporal Case 

The temporal case compares a short-interval of time to a longer interval of time. Temporal anomalies are commonplace in discussions of climate change.  

## Spatial case  

The spatial case compares a sub-region of space to a larger region that includes the sub-region. Spatial anomalies are commonplace in discussions of environmental justice and heterogeneity. Spatial anomalies challenge the ecological fallacy, or the idea that the characteristics of a population hold for all individuals of the population.
