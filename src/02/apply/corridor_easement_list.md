# River corridor easement outreach  

The State of Vermont’s [Climate Action Plan](https://climatechange.vermont.gov/sites/climatecouncilsandbox/files/2021-12/Initial%20Climate%20Action%20Plan%20-%20Final%20-%2012-1-21.pdf){target=_blank} anticipates that the next century will bring broad shifts in local patterns of precipitation and temperature. Annual temperatures are projected to increase over 2°F by 2050 and between 4 to 9°F by 2100. The number of days with extreme heat (defined by a high temperature of at least 90°F) are projected to double in frequency to nine days a year by 2050 and then increase to between 15 and 45 days a year by the century’s end. Annual precipitation is projected to increase one to two inches by 2050 and between four and nine inches by 2100.  Much of this increased precipitation will be delivered in higher intensity storms, as extreme precipitation events (those with more than two inches of rain in a 24-hour period) are expected to increase.    

These changes will directly impact the ecological function and habitat of lands for native plant and animal species. As a result, the goal of protecting 30 percent of terrestrial lands and waters by 2030 has been widely recognized as a pillar of climate change planning. The United Nations Convention on Biodiversity adopted 30 by '30 goal as one of ten 'milestones' in a global framework for managing nature through 2030. President Biden’s 2021 “Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad” also adopted the 30 by ‘30 goal.  

In Vermont, the [River Corridor Easement Program](https://dec.vermont.gov/watershed/rivers/river-corridor-and-floodplain-protection/protection) is one instrument available to compensate private land owners for extending protections on their lands. Your goal this week is to write a script in Earth Engine that identifies property owners with at least 50 acres of land within a designated river corridor for any watershed in Vermont. This tool could be used by municipal Conservation Commissions and private Land Trusts to contact land owners and initiate conversations that help us get closer to reaching 30 by '30 and subsequent 50 by '50 conservation goals.  

The app below illustrates that basic tool that you will make.

_Here is [a link](https://jhowarth.users.earthengine.app/view/eeprimer-river-corridor-easement){target=_blank} to the app that will open in a separate window._  

The CODE section below introduces the methods that you will use to make this app. Each snippet introduces a method with a toy case. Your task in our lab meeting will be to arrange these methods into a workflow that produces a map like the one shown above.
