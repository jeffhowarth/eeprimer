RGB composites visualize pixel values across three bands with the additive color system. The order of bands (first, second, third) corresponds to the color channel (red, green, blue) used to symbolize pixel values (sometimes called DN, or digital number).  

The chart below provides a key to the primary and secondary colors produced through the system. A high value in a single band with low values in the other two bands produces the primary colors (red, green, blue). High values in two bands with a low value in a third band produces the secondary colors (yellow, cyan, magenta). Low values in all three bands produce dark colors culminating in black when all values are zero. High values in all three bands produce unsaturated colors that culminate in white when all channels are maxed.
