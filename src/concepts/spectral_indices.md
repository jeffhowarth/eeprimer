##Normalized difference  

(first - second) / (first + second)   



The **normalized burn ratio (NBR)** is a normalized ratio so we are dividing the difference of two bands by their sum. NBR uses the SWIR 2 and NIR bands.

The **Burn Severity Index** is derived from the change in NBR before and after a fire. The classes shown below are standards proposed by the USGS.

The map shown at the top uses the thresholds that are not scaled (column on right).
