## Introduction       

- **Fire intensity:** intensity of fire while active  
- **Burn severity:** how fire intensity affects ecological functions of the burnt area (degree to which fire alters an area)

## Burn ratio    

- **Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR):**  ratio between NIR and SWIR2 bands. A high NBR indicates healthy vegetation while a low NBR value indicates bare ground and recently burnt areas.

## Severity classes  

- **Burn severity:** difference between pre-fire and post-fire NBR. A higher dNBR indicates more severe damage, while negative dNBR may indicate regrowth.

- **Severity level:** USGS thresholds for assigning severity classes.
