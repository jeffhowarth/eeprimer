## Definition  

Please define [land surface temperature (LST)](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/global-maps/MOD_LSTD_M){target=_blank} and explain how this differs from air surface temperature?

## LST from Landsat collections        

In this week's problem, we will apply a method to create high-resolution LST images from Landsat image collections that was developed and kindly shared by [Sophia Ermida](https://github.com/sofiaermida).

## LST and land cover  

The app below will help you compare land surface temperatures to land cover for anywhere in the world.

Please work with the app to explore Middlebury, Brooklyn, Seattle, and at least one other location of your choice.

For each, please think through these questions:  

1. At the extent of the scene, how does LST relate to land cover?  
2. At the scale of a city or town, how does LST vary and how is this related to land cover?  
3. What does the _histogram_ tell you about your scene?
4. Why do you need to adjust the min and max display values as your investigation changes location?  
5. Since you are displaying a _divergent color scheme_, how should you aim to set your min and max display values?
