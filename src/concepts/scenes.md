##Review Questions  

- What are _scenes_?  
- What are common _sources_ for image scenes and how do they differ?
- How does a _mosaic_ differ from a _composite_?

## Sources of scenes            

To get started, we should first discuss how Landsat 8 imagery differs from MODIS Terra imagery (what we used last week to look at global oceans).  

Try to fill out this table as we discuss the next few sections.  

| SATELLITE             | SPATIAL RESOLUTION  | TEMPORAL RESOLUTION |
| :---:                 | :---:               | :---:               |
| [MODIS TERRA][01]{target=_blank}     |
| [LANDSAT 8][02]{target=_blank}       |
| [SENTINEL 2][03]{target=_blank}      |

The app below will grab the scene from each satellite at the center of the map and then draw _natural color_ composites of each image.

## Where are the satellites at this moment?  

[Here's a map](https://earthnow.usgs.gov/observer/){target=_blank} that shows the location of US earth observing satellites (Landsat and MODIS platforms).

## How does Landsat's orbit influence scene mosaics?    

The video below animates how Landsat 8 images the entire surface of the planet.

## How does MODIS orbit influence scene mosaics?

The video below animates how [MODIS Aqua](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/#:~:text=Terra's%20orbit%20around%20the%20Earth,the%20equator%20in%20the%20afternoon.){target=_blank} images the planet's entire surface.
