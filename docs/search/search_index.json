They introduce core concepts of geographic information systems and remote sensing, methods for implementing these concepts with Earth Engine\u2019s javascript code editor, and a series of real-world problems and applications. This is a work in progress. I will be using it in Fall 2022 to teach a course in Environmental Studies and Geography at Middlebury College and it will be updated continuously. I\u2019ve organized the primer into chapters that each contain about a week\u2019s worth of content. Each chapter contains three sections: Introduces key words, concepts, and principles of spatial analysis, spatial problem-solving, geographic information systems, and remote sensing. Introduces code snippets to implement concepts with Google Earth Engine\u2019s code editor. Sketches geographic and environmental problems for students to solve by bringing together concepts and code. I am also developing problem sets to assess near and far transfer of understanding. In my course, these function as exams and for that reason I keep them in a private repository. If you are an instructor who would like access to these materials, please contact me.

Like any language, JavaScript has a vocabulary and grammar that you will learn through practice. This page introduces some key terms, syntax, and contexts for writing code with JavaScript. Like most of the pages tagged with in this primer, this page contains code snippets that you can copy and paste into the code editor to see their effects. To do this, open the code editor , copy and past the code snippets into it, and click RUN to execute the snippet. You can also save you script as a file by clicking the SAVE button. The file name should not have spaces and should end with .js to mark that it is a JavaScript file (e.g. javascript101.js ). Scripts A script is a sequence of statements that can be executed (when you \u2018run\u2019 the script). Lines A line is the basic organizing unit of a script. Think of a line like a ruling on a sheet of paper, while a statement is like the sentence that you write on the ruling. Each line has a number, shown on the left side of the text editor panel. These line indexes are helpful for troubleshooting code because if you make an error the code editor will usually tell you the line number that tripped it up. Comments A comment tells the computer: please ignore this . You often use comments to document your code and write little notes to yourself and to people who may read and want to reuse your code. They are like putting notes in the margins of a book without affecting the content of the book or like the director\u2019s commentary of a movie that can be muted when you watch. A line comment tells the computer not to execute anything that follows two forward slashes on a line. A multi-line comment tells the computer not to execute anything from a defined beginning and ending which may span multiple lines. // LINE COMMENTS start with two forward slashes. Like this line. The computer won't execute anything on this line that follows the slashes. /* MULTI LINE COMMENTS start with a forward slash and a star and end with a star and a forward slash. The computer won't execute anything between the stars, even if your comment spans many many lines . */ Script header It is good practice to begin every script with a header that states a title, your name, the date, and a brief description of the script\u2019s purpose. To do this, you can use either a line comment or multi-line comment. Here is an example of a header with line comments. Note how each line begins with two forward slashes. // ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ // TITLE: Javascript 101 // NAME: Your name here please // DATE: Today's date // PURPOSE: Getting started with JavaScript // ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Here is an example of a header with a multi-line comment. /* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ TITLE: Javascript 101 NAME: Your name here please DATE: Today's date PURPOSE: Getting started with JavaScript ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ */ Either method is fine. The most important thing is to remember to start each script with a header. Statements, objects, and variables When you write a script, you write statements to create and manipulate different kinds of data objects . An object class is an abstract template, while an instance is a manifestation of it. For example, the concept of \u2018a book\u2019 is like an object class, while \u2018the book sitting next to your bed\u2019 is an instance of this class. Sometimes you hear the words \u201ctype\u201d and \u201ctoken\u201d to describe the same distinction. A common statement involves first creating a container to store something and then putting an instance of a class into the container. In JavaScript, the container is called a variable . A variable can store different kinds of objects and you can name the variable (almost) anything that you want. // This statement creates the variable age_daughter to store an instance of a NUMBER object. var age_daughter = 4 ; // This statement creates the variable age_son to store an instance of a STRING object. A string starts and ends with a single quote. var age_son = 'six years old' ; // A string object can also start and end with double quotes, // (but don't mix and match them). var name_daughter = \"isabel\" ; // This variable stores a set of strings as a LIST object that is defined by square brackets. var kid_names = [ 'Aldo' , 'Isabel' ]; // This list stores a set of numbers. var kid_ages = [ 6 , 4 ]; // Curly brackets (or braces) can be used to define DICTIONARIES, or a set of KEY:VALUE pairs. var kidStats = { 'name' : 'Aldo' , 'age' : 6 , 'birthplace' : 'Middlebury, VT' }; Statement syntax If you examine these simple statements, you might recognize some basic rules of syntax. 1. How do you define a variable? In JavaScript, the statement starts with the keyword var followed by the equal sign. That clause says \u2018create a variable named\u2026\u2019. 2. What do you notice about the variable names? They follow a simple rule: The name of a variable cannot contain spaces. To honor this rule, you can follow two naming conventions for variables. // An example of the snake_case. var this_will_work = 'snake_case' ; // An example of the camelCase. var thisWillAlsoWork = 'camelCase' ; 3. What defines the object class of the instance? This is subtle, but important. The object class is coded by the format of the text in the statement. OBJECT CLASS FORMAT EXAMPLE NUMBER plain old number 4 STRING \u2018 \u2018 \u201d \u201c \u2018isabel\u2019 \u201ckid\u2019s\u201c LIST [ ] [\u2018aldo\u2019, \u2018isabel\u2019] DICTIONARY {:} {\u2018name\u2019: \u2018aldo\u2019} 4. How does each statement end? Do you see that little thing at the end of each statement winking at you? This is a mark of good coding practice: Statements should end in a semi-colon . // Statements should end in a SEMI-COLON, or the editor complains. var dangling = 'I feel incomplete...' var complete = 'This feels better, thanks.' ; In the above example, the editor will flag the line with a little italic i when you forget the semi-colon, but you may not notice this because the code will often still run. As you learn to write more complicated statements, however, forgetting to include a semi-colon can torpedo your code from executing. So it is good practice to think of the semi-colon as the period of a sentence and always end with it. Code documentation It is good practice to write comments to document every statement in your code. This will help you read your code if you put a script down for a period of time and return to it later. It will also help other people read and borrow from your code or help you troubleshoot errors. In this course, I will ask you to follow three principles of good coding practice with respect to documenting your scripts. 1. Write a comment for each statement that briefly describes its purpose. 2. Always document code with complete sentences that end with periods. 3. Write concise 1-2 sentence statements, not long-winded paragraphs. Print to console panel As you write code, it is good practice to check your work as you go. A common way of doing this is to print variables and then look at the result in the Console panel of the Code Editor. // Use print function and pass a string to it by enclosing in parentheses. print ( 'This string will print in the Console panel.' ); // You can also pass a variable to the print function. print ( kid_names ); // Use commas to pass more than one item to the print function. print ( \"my kids\" , kid_names ); Functions The print command is an example of a function , or something more like a verb than a noun. A function can take arguments and deliver results. As illustrated by the print function, you pass arguments to a function by enclosing them in parentheses. Object methods Every object class will have a set of functions that you can call to manipulate instances of that object class. These are often called methods . Here is an example for a list object. // Use a period and parentheses to call a METHOD of an object (a function that works with an object). var kids_reversed = kid_names . reverse (); print ( 'Kids in reverse order' , kids_reversed ); Earth Engine objects All the examples above deal with native JavaScript objects and methods. Earth Engine provides a large set of additional objects and methods for working with geographic information. In the chapters that follow, you will learn how to use JavaScript to access these tools. The syntax and grammar for using these tools are largely the same as what we have discussed above. If this all feels new and slightly overwhelming, please do not stress out. It will become familiar through practice.

The layer metaphor goes back to the days when people would place a mylar sheet on top of a reference map and then draw shapes on the mylar. Thus the reference map was the base layer and each mylar sheet put on top of it was a thematic layer . Even though we don\u2019t use mylar anymore, the map layer metaphor is helpful as a conceptual device. In the example below, I assume you have a point object named \u2018point\u2019. Map . addLayer ( point , // Geometry object to show on the map. { color : 'blue' }, // Color to display the objects. 'My first point' // A label for the layer that will appear in the label panel. ); Please note: If you don\u2019t seen the point on your map, it may be because it is not in your current map extent. So you will need to zoom out and pan around to find it.

For example, the method .length() calculates the length of a line (or \u2018LineString\u2019) object. To call the method, you append .length() to the variable that stores the line object. The snippet below assumes that you have a line object named \u2018line\u2019. // Calculate the length of a line object. var line_length = line . length () ; // Inspect result. print ( 'route distance' , line_length ); Check your understanding What statement would you write to find the center of the line? Hint: use the Docs tab to look for a method associated with ee.Geometry.LineString that sounds like it would calculate the center of the line.","title":"Calculate line length"},{"location":"code/01/centerObject/","text":"Center map on an object You can also define your map extent so that the map centers on a geometry object, like a sample point or city center. In the example below, I assume you have a point object named \u2018point\u2019. // Center on a point. Map . centerObject ( point , 4 ); Check your understanding If you have the choice, should you center the map before you add a layer, or add a layer before you center the map, or do you think that the sequence really does not matter?","title":"Center map on object"},{"location":"code/01/constructFeature/","text":"Construct a feature A geometry object represents where , but not what is where. In other words, geometry objects represent geographic locations, but they do not describe conditions or properties of these locations. For example, you can store the location of a town with a geometry object, but not the town\u2019s name, population, area, etc. A feature object stores both the geometry and qualitative and/or quantitative properties of a location. Often, you will hear people who are accustomed to geographic information systems use the word attribute rather than property. For our purposes, they are synonymous. Usually, the attributes of features will be defined as part of a data product. But you can also define and alter attributes as necessary with code. Earth Engine provides a method to make features by calling ee.Feature(). As arguments (between the parentheses), it takes a geometry object and the attributes. The attributes must be defined as a dictionary with a key and a value. You might think of this like a data table: the key is the column title and the value is the row. The example below again assumes that you have a point object named \u2018point\u2019. // Set a property of point. var point_feature = ee . Feature ( point , { name : 'my first point' }); // Print the two different objects to compare. print ( 'Point as geometry' , point , 'Point as feature' , point_feature ); Check your understanding Try to change the name of the feature to 'Gulf of Guinea'.

When you stretch a string tightly between two points on a globe, you show the great circle route . This shows the shortest distance across the globe\u2019s surface between the two points. Google Earth Engine uses a spheroid model to represent line objects. The resulting lines represent great circle routes, just like if you were working with a string and a globe. Earth Engine provides a method to construct line objects from two or more points. You call the method with the phrase ee.Geometry.LineString(). It takes a list of points as an argument. // Construct two points. var point = ee . Geometry . Point ([ 0 , 0 ]); var point2 = ee . Geometry .
