They introduce core concepts of geographic information systems and remote sensing, methods for implementing these concepts with Earth Engine\u2019s javascript code editor, and a series of real-world problems and applications. This is a work in progress. I will be using it in Fall 2022 to teach a course in Environmental Studies and Geography at Middlebury College and it will be updated continuously. I\u2019ve organized the primer into chapters that each contain about a week\u2019s worth of content. Each chapter contains three sections: Introduces key words, concepts, and principles of spatial analysis, spatial problem-solving, geographic information systems, and remote sensing. Introduces code snippets to implement concepts with Google Earth Engine\u2019s code editor. Sketches geographic and environmental problems for students to solve by bringing together concepts and code. I am also developing problem sets to assess near and far transfer of understanding. In my course, these function as exams and for that reason I keep them in a private repository. If you are an instructor who would like access to these materials, please contact me.

Does the flight path follow the great circle route between the two airports? In theory, this route represents the shortest geographic distance between these two locations. To begin to answer this question, please create a map that shows the great circle route between the two airports. Please copy and paste the starter script (below) into the code editor and then save it to your repo. Please write one or more lines of code to \u2018answer\u2019 each prompt. We will discuss both your solution (script) and our original question (does the flight follow the great circle route?) in our next class meeting. At that time, I will also show you how to submit your scripts and document your coursework this semester.

Like any language, JavaScript has a vocabulary and grammar that you will learn through practice. This page introduces some key terms, syntax, and contexts for writing code with JavaScript. Like most of the pages tagged with in this primer, this page contains code snippets that you can copy and paste into the code editor to see their effects. To do this, open the code editor , copy and past the code snippets into it, and click RUN to execute the snippet. You can also save you script as a file by clicking the SAVE button. The file name should not have spaces and should end with .js to mark that it is a JavaScript file (e.g. javascript101.js ). Scripts A script is a sequence of statements that can be executed (when you \u2018run\u2019 the script). Lines A line is the basic organizing unit of a script. Think of the line more like the rulings on a sheet of paper, while a statement are the sentences that you write on the rulings. Each line has a number, shown on the left side of the text editor panel. These line indexes are helpful for troubleshooting code because if you make an error the code editor will usually tell you the line number that tripped it up. Comments A comment tells the computer: please ignore this . You often use comments to document your code and write little notes to yourself and to people who may read and want to reuse your code. They are like putting notes in the margins of a book without affecting the content of the book or like the director\u2019s commentary of a movie that can be muted when you watch. A line comment tells the computer not to execute anything that follows two forward slashes on a line. A multi-line comment tells the computer not to execute anything from a defined beginning and ending which may span multiple lines. // LINE COMMENTS start with two forward slashes. Like this line. The computer won't execute anything on this line that follows the slashes. /* MULTI LINE COMMENTS start with a forward slash and a star and end with a star and a forward slash. The computer won't execute anything between the stars, even if your comment spans many many lines . */ Script header It is good practice to begin every script with a header that states a title, your name, the date, and a brief description of the script\u2019s purpose. To do this, you can use either a line comment or multi-line comment. Here is an example of a header with line comments. Note how each line begins with two forward slashes. // ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ // TITLE: Javascript 101 // NAME: Your name here please // DATE: Today's date // PURPOSE: Getting started with Javascript // ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Here is an example of a header with a multi-line comment. /* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ TITLE: Javascript 101 NAME: Your name here please DATE: Today's date PURPOSE: Getting started with Javascript ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ */ Either method is fine. The most important thing is to remember to start each script with a header. Statements, objects, and variables When you write a script, you write statements to create and manipulate different kinds of data objects . An object class is an abstract template, while an instance is a manifestation of it. For example, the concepts of \u2018a book\u2019 is like an object class, while \u2018the book sitting next to your bed\u2019 is an instance of this class. Sometimes you hear the words \u201ctype\u201d and \u201ctoken\u201d to describe the same distinction. A common statement involves first creating a container to store something and then putting an instance of a class into the container. In JavaScript, the container is called a variable . A variable can store different kinds of objects and you can name the variable (almost) anything that you want. // This statement creates the variable age_daughter to store an instance of a NUMBER object. var age_daughter = 4 ; // This statement creates the variable age_son to store an instance of a STRING object. A string starts and ends with a single quote. var age_son = 'six years old' ; // A string object can also start and end with double quotes, // (but don't mix and match them). var name_daughter = \"isabel\" ; // This variable stores a set of strings as a LIST object that is defined by square brackets. var kid_names = [ 'Aldo' , 'Isabel' ]; // This list stores a set of numbers. var kid_ages = [ 6 , 4 ]; // Curly brackets (or braces) can be used to define DICTIONARIES, or a set of KEY:VALUE pairs. var kidStats = { 'name' : 'Aldo' , 'age' : 6 , 'birthplace' : 'Middlebury, VT' }; Statement syntax If you examine these simple statements, you might recognize some basic rules of syntax. 1. How do you define a variable? In JavaScript, the statement starts with the keyword var followed by the equal sign. That clause says \u2018create a variable named\u2026\u2019. 2. What do you notice about the variable names? They follow a simple rule: The name of a variable cannot contain spaces. To honor this rule, you can follow two naming conventions for variables. // An example of the snake_case. var this_will_work = 'snake_case' ; // An example of the camelCase. var thisWillAlsoWork = 'camelCase' ; 3. What defines the object class of the instance? This is subtle, but important. The object class is coded by the format of the text in the statement. OBJECT CLASS FORMAT EXAMPLE NUMBER plain old number 4 STRING \u2018 \u2018 \u201d \u201c \u2018isabel\u2019 \u201ckid\u2019s\u201c LIST [ ] [\u2018aldo\u2019, \u2018isabel\u2019] DICTIONARY {:} {\u2018name\u2019: \u2018aldo\u2019} 4. How does each statement end? Do you see that little thing at the end of each statement winking at you? This is a mark of good coding practice: Statements should end in a semi-colon . // Statements should end in a SEMI-COLON, or the editor complains. var dangling = 'I feel incomplete...' var complete = 'This feels better, thanks.' ; In the above example, the editor will flag the line with a little italic i when you forget the semi-colon, but you may not notice this because the code will often still run. As you learn to write more complicated statements, however, forgetting to include a semi-colon can torpedo your code from executing. So it is good practice to think of the semi-colon as the period of a sentence and always end with it. Code documentation It is good practice to write comments to document every statement in your code. This will help you read your code if you put a script down for a period of time and return to it later. It will also help other people read and borrow from your code or help you troubleshoot errors. In this course, I will ask you to follow three principles of good coding practice with respect to documenting your scripts. 1. Write a comment for each statement that briefly describes its purpose. 2. Always document code with complete sentences that end with periods. 3. Write concise 1-2 sentence statements, not long-winded paragraphs. Print to console panel As you write code, it is good practice to check your work as you go. A common way of doing this is to print variables and then look at the result in the Console panel of the Code Editor. // Use print function and pass a string to it by enclosing in parentheses. print ( 'This string will print in the Console tab.' ); // Pass a variable to the print function. print ( kid_names ); // Use commas to pass more than one item to the print function. print ( \"my kids\" , kid_names ); Functions The print command is an example of a function , or something more like a verb than a noun. A function can take arguments and deliver results. As illustrated by the print function, you pass arguments to a function by enclosing them in parentheses. Object methods Every object class will have a set of functions that you can call to manipulate instances of that object class. These are often called methods . Here is an example for a list object. // Use a period and parentheses to call a METHOD of an object (a function that works with an object). var kids_reversed = kid_names . reverse (); print ( 'Kids in reverse order' , kids_reversed ); Earth Engine objects All the examples above deal with native JavaScript objects and methods. Earth Engine provides a large set of additional objects and methods for working with geographic information. In the chapters that follow, you will learn how to use JavaScript to access these tools. And the syntax and grammar for using these tools are largely the same as what we have discussed above. If this all feels new and slightly overwhelming, please do not stress out. It will become familiar through practice.

Usually, the attributes of features will be defined as part of a data product. But you can also define and alter attributes as necessary with code.
