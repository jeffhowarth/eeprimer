It takes about 19 hours. Please make a map that estimates the average speed of the flight in kilometers per hour (length in kilometers / 19 hours). Your code should produce something that looks like this: To help you find the airports, here is a screen shot that shows the location of SIN: And another that shows the location of JFK. Starter script Please copy and paste this starter script into the code editor and then save it to your repo. We will discuss the solution in our next class meeting. I will show you how to submit your code then. // ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ // Problem: The longest haul // Date: Today's date // Student: Your name here please // ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ // Construct point geometry objects for SIN and JFK. // Construct line geometry object between the two airports. // Estimate the average route speed in kilometers per hour (assuming 19 hour flight). // Create a feature that stores the 'avg_speed' as a property of the line. // Inspect the result by printing to Console. // Center the map on the line feature with a zoom level of 2. // Change the base map to hybrid. // Add the line feature to the map, display it with red, and label the layer 'Longest haul route'.","title":"Shortest route for the longest haul"},{"location":"code/01/addVectorLayer/","text":"Add vector layer to map Here is how you can add a vector layer to a map.

When you stretch a string tightly between two points on a globe, you show the great circle route . This shows the shortest distance across the globe\u2019s surface between the two points. Google Earth Engine uses a spheroid model to represent line objects. The resulting lines represent great circle routes, just like if you were working with a string and a globe. Here is how to construct a line object from two point objects: // Construct two points. var point = ee . Geometry . Point ([ 0 , 0 ]); var point2 = ee . Geometry . Point ([ - 90 , 60 ]); // Construct line from two points. var line = ee . Geometry .

In other words, geometry objects only represent geographic locations. They do not describe anything else about these locations. A feature object represents properties of a location. Often, you will hear people who are accustomed to geographic information systems use the word attribute rather than property. For our purposes, they are synonymous. Usually, the attributes of features will be defined as part of a data product. But you can also define and alter attributes as necessary with code. In Earth Engine, a property is stored as a dictionary with a key and a value. You might think of this like a table: the key is the column title and the value is the row.
