While most of the lessons introduce methods and workflows in Google Earth Engine, I also show students around QGIS and how to move between the two platforms. The ultimate goal of the materials is to help students learn timeless concepts of geospatial analysis that transcend specific software platforms. That is the goal at least. </p> <p>I use the materials to teach undergraduates at Middlebury College (Vermont, USA) and revise the materials every fall semester while teaching. This means that I scrub the site in September and then publish revised materials each week through December.  </p> <p>Please contact me if you have any questions. </p> <p>Jeff Howarth Associate Professor of Geography Middlebury College, Middlebury, Vermont, USA jhowarth@middlebury.edu </p> <p>This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.</p>"},{"location":"toolbox/GEE/","title":"Google Earth Engine","text":""},{"location":"toolbox/GEE/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Google Earth Engine (GEE) is cloud-based geographic information system (GIS) that is (currently) free to use for educational and research purposes.

The lovely thing about GEE is that all of this work gets done on Google\u2019s servers in the cloud. All you will need to work with GEE is a web browser, preferably Google Chrome, and a decent internet connection.
