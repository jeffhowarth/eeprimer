## Interpreting results

_Please work through the prompts below and be prepared to share your responses in class on April 11._  

### Part 1: Global oceans

#### Introduction   

In the figure from [Hoegh-Guldberg et al (2014)](../lessons/images/global_oceans.jpg), scientists divided the world into sub-regions based on a set of spatial and temporal attributes (ocean depth, concentration and timing of chlorophyll-a, sea surface temperatures and seasonal changes, spatial relationships to global currents, etc).  

In principle, spatial and temporal attributes should be similar within each instance of a geographic category. In other words, a Coastal Boundary System in one region of the world should have similar attributes as a Coastal Boundary System in another region of the world.  

Similarly, spatial and temporal attributes should differ between different instances of a geographic category. For example, the attributes of a Coastal Boundary System should differ from the attributes of an Eastern Boundary Upwelling Ecosystem.  

#### Questions     

_The questions below prompt you to consider similarities and differences between the ocean regions shown in the figure from Hoegh-Guldberg et al (2014)._    

_To answer the questions, please refer to the layers that you made last week in the [global oceans](../lessons/global_oceans.md) lesson. Please also refer to this figure of [global ocean currents](https://ugc.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ocean_currents2.jpg) and this figure of arctic polar currents [arctic](https://www.whoi.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/graphics-To_IMS-ArcticCurrentsMap-1024x576.jpg)._       

1. Compare and contrast the regions categorized as northern (1a) and southern (1b) High-Latitude Spring Bloom Systems. Please make two lists. One list should identify the spatial and temporal attributes that are similar between the two kinds of regions and the other should list the attributes that differ. To compile the lists, compare and contrast patterns that are visible in the geographic reference features (geographic lines and/or graticule), bathymetry, chlorophyll-a concentrations, and SST layers that you made in class last week. Also compare and contrast the regions to the ocean currents.       

2. Compare and contrast regions categorized as Coastal Boundary Systems (4) and Eastern Boundary Upwelling Ecosystems (5). Please make two lists as described in question 1.  

3. Compare and contrast the regions categorized as Equatorial Upwelling Systems (2) and Subtropical Gyres (6). Please make two lists as described in question 1.

4. Compare and contrast the five regions categorized as Semi-Enclosed Seas (3). Please make two lists. On one, please list the spatial and temporal characteristics that the five regions have in common. On the other, please list spatial and temporal characteristics that differ between the five regions.  

5. Which ocean categories do you think are the strongest? Which ocean categories do you think are the weakest? Why?    

### Part 2: Description and explanation         

#### Introduction  

Making maps with remotely-sensed imagery helps us _describe_ the world in ways that are difficult or impossible through direct experience. But to _explain_ the patterns on our maps, we need to understand the geographic processes that are linked to them.

Many of the surface temperature patterns we mapped last week are linked to the global circulation system. If you are not familiar with how this system works, Met Office has produced [three short educations videos](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/atmosphere/global-circulation-patterns) that introduce many of the key concepts. Similarly, if you are not familiar with how ENSO works, Met Office has also produced [a helpful video](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/oceans/el-nino) that introduces this global system.       

#### Questions  

After brushing up on these global processes, please look at the five Daytime Land Surface Temperatures (the record average and the four seasonal averages).  

1. Why are the highest land surface temperatures _not_ found at the equator?  

2. Where are the highest land surface temperatures found?  

3. Why are these hottest regions of the world found where they are?
